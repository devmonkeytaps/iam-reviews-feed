It seems that every time an update is released the past few months, there are issues and bugs. I wish the developers would work out these bugs before releasing new updates. But I am still a user and subscriber, and it is a very helpful app. Just I want to warn people to maybe make a back up of your affirmations in another app or journal and do not count on them being safe in your I Am account.', 'author': 'Kimberly888', 'version': '6.8.0'}, {'date': '2025-11-05', 'rating': 5, 'country': 'US', 'title': 'Thanks', 'content': 'This is helping me breathe', 'author': 'Gretta’s report', 'version': '6.7.0'}, {'date': '2025-11-05', 'rating': 5, 'country': 'AU', 'title': 'The best', 'content': 'It is really good because it helps my son with anxiety I really recommend it', 'author': 'rivytwotimes', 'version': '6.7.0'}, {'date': '2025-11-05', 'rating': 1, 'country': 'AU', 'title': 'Waisted my time answering and it cost money', 'content': '😢 dissaponted', 'author': 'M 🤷\u200d♀️ A', 'version': '6.7.0'}, {'date': '2025-11-05', 'rating': 5, 'country': 'US', 'title': '“The best Affirmation application “!!!!', 'content': 'This app is such a blessing unto my being and soul!!

With my mental health i have to be careful around spiritual/manifestation phrases\n\n-no option to say i am physically disabled so im assuming i can’t get affirmations revolving around that. Which is very unfortunate. It also makes the manifestation affirmations that pop up feel more bitter than anything. I don’t need affirmations on how i can do anything i want, i would like affirmations to be okay with my limits and my body, and be taking things at my own pace. There’s some things people will never be able to do. Thats just a fact, not negativity. Realist gentle affirmations with disabled people in mind should be a filter you can click and opt in to from the very beginning.', 'author': '🌻💛🌼', 'version': '6.7.0'}, {'date': '2025-11-03', 'rating': 1, 'country': 'US', 'title': 'Payment Required', 'content': 'Careful!
