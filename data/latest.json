And, Apperantly, it won’t record any of my data anymore service I cancelled my subscripttionthat doesn’t end for another flipping year!!! \n\nThere is no way of contacting them and I really don’t see the benefit of passing close to $80/year to have priorice afternoons sent to you every day… nothing else… I don’t get it.

The subscription is $18 a month and currently I can't afford that. I feel like if we have to pay for the affirmations you should've just made it a paid app in the first place rather than try to swindle people out of money after they download the app thinking that there is actually a free plan.

I need assistance canceling the current subscription as I don't plan on updating my payment to allow a charge. PLEASE HELP.",

I enjoyed it at first, but it seems with every update they are removing more and more features from the free version. I’m a college student, and I simply do not have the spare income for a subscription. They are limiting the backgrounds, the customization of the affirmations (and the rest of the app), and now have even taken away the “practice” option, something I used nearly every day. Unfortunately this is a common occurrence with supposedly free apps. I’m not sure how much longer this one will be of use to me. The setup is user friendly, the affirmations are unique and really boosted my self esteem. It was very helpful during a hard time in my life, but I no longer think this is beneficial the way it used to be.",
