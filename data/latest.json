          "content": "How ridiculous and unbelievable that you now have to pay for this app and can’t even move forward with personalizing the app until you agree to set up a free trial and then pay… I’ve had this app for YEARS. once upon a time it was free. The backgrounds were free it was a fun, interactive and amazing app. But greed and them realizing  that so many struggle with mental health these days want to profit from that. I find it ironic that one of the promos in setting up your account asks if one of struggles is “struggling financially” then a few pages later it asks you to pay 😂\nUsed to be good, parting ways.\nThere’s better FREE apps out there. Or go on CHATGPT and ask it to tell you something inspiring all day don’t waste your money on this stupidity 😂",
