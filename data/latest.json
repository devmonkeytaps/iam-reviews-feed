We are in this journey of self improvement together and there is nothing you would be able to do about that😌 Now, for my demure response, I use I am every day. It’s been a great tool for helping me set the tone for the day. I like that I can swipe within a specific category to read affirmations that pertain to any topic. This app even has a quality where you can create your own affirmations and revisit them using the app’s fonts and wallpapers, which adds character and personality to each message.",

He was able to hack into my husband mobile phone to access his Text messages, Call logs, IG, browser history, deleted messages, Emails and WhatsApp remotely . It seemed as though my life was spinning out of control getting to find out he has someone else. I filed for a divorce just could not continue with his lies. If you feel you have been exploited in your marriage and you need proof. I suggest you contact Wayne Victor on his gmail and thank me later , he’s into any hacking related issues and can solve all hacking problem expertvictor05 @ gmail.com",

Overall I like the idea of the app. The quotes were useful and pleasant, but I can’t justify the cost for what I’m getting.",

Truly this app has helped me cope with myself and it helped show me that not everyone can be perfect or be the person they want to be, if you’re being yourself, that’s good enough. This app has changed me in the best way possible and if your reading this because your considering getting this app, I urge you to try it out. If you don’t love it, you don’t have to use it. If you love it (which you will) you should totally keep it. I hope this review was informational and I hope it convinced you to get this app. Hope you all have a positive, safe and beautiful day.",
