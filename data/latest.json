Instead they would say things like “I’m facing a difficult time now, but I can get through it” but no I’m not going through a hard time… what’s your deal lol they gave you prompts when you set it up, I chose manifest abundance, gratitude, and positive thinking, why are you keep feeding me negative thoughts🤦🏻‍♀️",

If this was fixed and I could use the full version that I am paying for, I would give it a 5.",
