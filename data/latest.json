          "content": "Tried to cancel this app before the 3 day trial ended. I wasn’t shown as being enrolled and affirmations weren’t sending. Sure enough, on day 4 more affirmations than I even set up for my daily feed started rolling through and despite traveling everywhere I could think of on both days 3 and 4, there is no customer service/cancellation to be found. Make sure your phone settings let you cancel from there if you want the option for a trial. And know your trial will not reflect the services they promise in this app. I am so irritated by seeing affirmations pop up after I tried to cancel this service I will likely delete the whole app despite having paid a ridiculous $69 for it.",
