I have a multi-month streak and I love saving and organizing my affirmations into “boards” super fun :)\nCon: the art is heavily ai generated and they want you to pay for a lot of the customization or different affirmations. Basically anything that’s not the base app is a payment, which I wouldn’t find an issue with except the art isn’t even from a real artist and you can TELL it’s very badly generated ai images which isn’t the best look when you can generate ai images for free and you’re making users pay for that image. I hope they reach out and take Critique from their users, not share holders.\nI’ve tried to find alternative apps but that’s what keeps their users. There is none.",

Make sure your phone settings let you cancel from there if you want the option for a trial. And know your trial will not reflect the services they promise in this app. I am so irritated by seeing affirmations pop up after I tried to cancel this service I will likely delete the whole app despite having paid a ridiculous $69 for it.",
