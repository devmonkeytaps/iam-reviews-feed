Obviously it isn't a miracle cure, but these are some of the best affirmations especially since they go along with a background/cute icon/work well with my screen. They just make me happy and I genuinely have no problem paying the tiny subscription!",

I signed up for a 3 day trial after going through all their stupid questionnaire it basically made me do it BUT it said to receive a notification BEFORE the 3 day trial was up so I could decide if I wanted to keep it or not. I never received such notification and they charged me $75!!! First off, $75 is a CRAZY amount of money to even charge for something like this and second of all, the fact that they didn’t notify when they said they would proves what a scam they really are! I’ve requested a refund through Apple and I hope to God I get it but if not I’m going full Karen on all of them!",

Truly this app has helped me cope with myself and it helped show me that not everyone can be perfect or be the person they want to be, if you’re being yourself, that’s good enough. This app has changed me in the best way possible and if your reading this because your considering getting this app, I urge you to try it out. If you don’t love it, you don’t have to use it. If you love it (which you will) you should totally keep it. I hope this review was informational and I hope it convinced you to get this app. Hope you all have a positive, safe and beautiful day.",

          "content": "I used to love this app and I used it every morning with the “practice” feature for 15 mins to help brighten my day in the morning because I would listen to the affirmations being spoken while I would get ready. However, I will no longer be using this app. The practice feature is now behind a paywall that offers a 3-day free trial and then you have to PAY $70 PER YEAR. I’m sorry, but that is just too much for a simple affirmation app. I loved this app so much but now that almost everything is behind a paywall, I am going to stop using this app because the greed of the company is honestly disgusting to me. I hope they learn that they will continuously lose customers because of their greed. They do not care about their customers enjoying the app. All they care about is money.",

I think it’s a cool app but for the price point it’s ridiculous. My bigger issue is that I requested a trial and explicitly requested I be notified before the trial ended so that I could cancel. I was NEVER notified, by email or push notification. So it automatically tried charging me. Yes, I should have kept track of that myself, so I do take some responsibility but if you’re not going to notify people then don’t tell them you are as then I would have made absolutely sure I kept track of it myself.

Every time I looked at my watch I was reminded of something I wanted to focus on. And if I wanted to cycle through all my favorites, I could just tap on it to get to the rest. Now, when I look at my watch I just see generic affirmations I’m not interested in. When I tap on it I can get to the rest, but I don’t want to have to do that.

Their description talks about a “premium” version like it’s a separate thing that you can upgrade to to get all the benefits for, but the app itself is the full premium version. You get 3 days of free access to the premium version before you have to subscribe. \n\nRespectfully, to anyone reading this, no I’m not some entitled individual who thinks they should get everything for free. I wouldn’t be making this if I was told in the description or upon starting the app there would only be 3 days of access before you have to subscribe. I’m not sure if this was done on purpose or if it was by mistake, but I believe you guys have to be more specific so you don’t waste anyone’s time. Especially when it comes to someone’s mental health. \n\nAnyways, thanks for reading this. I appreciate any feedback about this if you feel it’s needed or if I’m mistaken about something 🙏.",
