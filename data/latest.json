However this app sends me notifications every 3 minutes.\n\n2 - The paid version promoted the fact that if you pay and add the account - all info will be saved. Guess what? I got a new phone, logged in to my iCloud and used the same account for this app - and 100% of info was completely lost",

After the recent update, I can’t seem to find that option anywhere. If it’s been removed, that’s truly disappointing. It was such a meaningful part of my daily routine and one of the main reasons I’ve stayed a loyal user all these years. Please consider bringing it back — otherwise, I’ll have to rethink renewing my subscription.",

Every affirmation after the one I hearted will basically be the exact same one I hearted and it’s super annoying! I have specific categories I love and use those in addition to the “general” category, I have the ones I want in my rotation liked so I would expect that affirmations would rotate through most of those categories but they don’t do that anymore. It’s become such a nuisance that I eventually close out of the app altogether after only a minute or two at most. I pay for this app because I used to love the variety of affirmations I would receive so I could expand my horizons and figure out what is challenging for me, please go back to the old algorithm or find a way to fix it, otherwise I will be stopping my use of the subscription altogether.",

Really helped me rebound from a tough spot. \n\nBut the recent updates seem to have limited the usage? I once could practice affirmations with music playing in the background from other apps. And there was an option for voice preference which I enjoyed. The default one now feels flat. Anyway we can get these features back??",

I have been married to my husband for years with no idea he was cheating. Suddenly i started noticing changes in behavior, i suspected something was wrong So i confided in a friend who convinced and introduced me to an hacker. He was able to hack into my husband mobile phone to access his Text messages, Call logs, IG, browser history, deleted messages, Emails and WhatsApp remotely . It seemed as though my life was spinning out of control getting to find out he has someone else. I filed for a divorce just could not continue with his lies. If you feel you have been exploited in your marriage and you need proof. I suggest you contact Wayne Victor on his gmail and thank me later , he’s into any hacking related issues and can solve all hacking problem expertvictor05 @ gmail.com",
