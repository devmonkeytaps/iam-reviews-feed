I have been married to my husband for years with no idea he was cheating. Suddenly i started noticing changes in behavior, i suspected something was wrong So i confided in a friend who convinced and introduced me to an hacker. He was able to hack into my husband mobile phone to access his Text messages, Call logs, IG, browser history, deleted messages, Emails and WhatsApp remotely . It seemed as though my life was spinning out of control getting to find out he has someone else. I filed for a divorce just could not continue with his lies. If you feel you have been exploited in your marriage and you need proof. I suggest you contact Wayne Victor on his gmail and thank me later , he‚Äôs into any hacking related issues and can solve all hacking problem expertvictor05 @ gmail.com",

I haven‚Äôt had very many issues with it personally, but I notice the widget affirmations never match up with the affirmations I choose in the app. Also, today one of the widget affirmations used a very vulgar word that should not even be used in such an app. I hope that you fix this because I feel more people will download this app if you do. Other than that, this app has been very helpful to me! I treat the streak as if it‚Äôs Duolingo üòã",

It reminded me to take deep breaths and appreciate. 10/10 app. Thank you.",

First off, $75 is a CRAZY amount of money to even charge for something like this and second of all, the fact that they didn‚Äôt notify when they said they would proves what a scam they really are!
