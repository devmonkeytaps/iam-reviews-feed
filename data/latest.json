          "content": "Here I am and the Streak Reminder hasn’t worked the last 4 days and the last 2 days, not getting any affirmations — yes, I have cleared all my notifications on my home screen as previously suggested. I’m feeling frustrated because I’ve had this app 2 years and until this year, I had virtually no issues. I hope you can fix this quickly because I really do love this app and it is good for me.\n\n**UPDATE TO REVIEW**\n15JAN26– this app has continued to get worse the longer that I use it. I haven’t received any affirmations in a week now; yes, I’ve cleared all my notifications. And with their last update to the app itself, the alarm for my streak reminder has disappeared. In addition, when I manually open the app, the screen is white and takes nearly 20 full seconds to load. I definitely will not continue my paid subscription when it’s due for renewal. This app has had too many bugs, glitches, and in hasn’t worked consistently and properly in months.\n\n[22JAN26] MonkeyTaps you say you read every single review..  another week has elapsed and I have not received one single affirmation. I’ve been cleaning ALL my notifications on my iPhone as previously instructed. I’ve updated the app, I’ve rebooted, I’ve manually opened the app, etc., and still nothing. I don’t know why your team hasn’t yet fixed this issue. I do like the app— when it works properly.\n\n[06FEB26] - I guess no one reads this but I’m going to write anyway. My app gave me affirmations all day this past Tuesday after not working for a couple weeks. However, it gave me the “Tap Here to Continue Receiving Affirmations” warning (which was random because it had been giving me my affirmations regularly up to that moment on Tuesday. Since that notification popped up, I’ve had no more affirmations.\n\n[10FEB26] — though I have the most recent update, there’s still a glitch in the coding apparently. Two days ago, I finally started receiving my affirmations. They were constant until the “Tap to continue receiving notifications” popped up. I clicked on it, it took me to the Home Screen of the app, but that’s where the affirmations stopped. This is what happened last time. Please fix this app. Show that you care about providing an app that is reliable and helpful more than just intermittently.\n\n[18FEB26] — I guess this company is not interested in constructive feedback and trying to remove the errors/glitches in their app. I’ve gotten 1 actual affirmation in the last 5 days. I have, as always, done everything it suggests to trouble shoot so I know it’s in the coding and not on my end. I definitely will not renew this app; what’s the point of trying to improve my thinking if the app doesn’t work and the developers don’t care to fix it.",

I love the different themes and how you can customize the background and at that time the price was about $1.49 per month to unlock all themes and categories which i loved. Now, the price for premium went up to $14.99 per month. I think this is ridiculous. Also I noticed a year ago that they introduced AI! Which is crazy. If the developers would lower the price then I think people would pay for it. It’s crazy how it’s only about 5 free categories amongst 15-20. Anything for a buck,  I guess. I’ll be deleting the app",

          "content": "I’ve used the app for a few weeks now and I’m just not impressed. There’s not much to it at all. The “practice” of daily affirmations is just a series of sentences being read to you in a robotic voice. The interface is pretty, but that’s about it. I don’t know why the introductory questionnaire even exists because all of the settings/topics I chose at the beginning aren’t the focus when you get into the app. You can choose from a multitude of subjects to focus on but then I find myself irritated that I have to scroll thru them all again and again if I want to change anything. There’s no real incentive or insights available while you’re using it either- just prompts you to “read” the affirmations each day and then- boom, you’re done! It’s just boring AI slop.",

I’m feeling frustrated because I’ve had this app 2 years and until this year, I had virtually no issues. I hope you can fix this quickly because I really do love this app and it is good for me.\n\n**UPDATE TO REVIEW**\n15JAN26– this app has continued to get worse the longer that I use it. I haven’t received any affirmations in a week now; yes, I’ve cleared all my notifications. And with their last update to the app itself, the alarm for my streak reminder has disappeared. In addition, when I manually open the app, the screen is white and takes nearly 20 full seconds to load. I definitely will not continue my paid subscription when it’s due for renewal. This app has had too many bugs, glitches, and in hasn’t worked consistently and properly in months.\n\n[22JAN26] MonkeyTaps you say you read every single review..  another week has elapsed and I have not received one single affirmation. I’ve been cleaning ALL my notifications on my iPhone as previously instructed. I’ve updated the app, I’ve rebooted, I’ve manually opened the app, etc., and still nothing. I don’t know why your team hasn’t yet fixed this issue. I do like the app— when it works properly.\n\n[06FEB26] - I guess no one reads this but I’m going to write anyway. My app gave me affirmations all day this past Tuesday after not working for a couple weeks. However, it gave me the “Tap Here to Continue Receiving Affirmations” warning (which was random because it had been giving me my affirmations regularly up to that moment on Tuesday. Since that notification popped up, I’ve had no more affirmations.\n\n[10FEB26] — though I have the most recent update, there’s still a glitch in the coding apparently. Two days ago, I finally started receiving my affirmations. They were constant until the “Tap to continue receiving notifications” popped up. I clicked on it, it took me to the Home Screen of the app, but that’s where the affirmations stopped. This is what happened last time. Please fix this app. Show that you care about providing an app that is reliable and helpful more than just intermittently.",

I’m feeling frustrated because I’ve had this app 2 years and until this year, I had virtually no issues. I hope you can fix this quickly because I really do love this app and it is good for me.\n\n**UPDATE TO REVIEW**\n15JAN26– this app has continued to get worse the longer that I use it. I haven’t received any affirmations in a week now; yes, I’ve cleared all my notifications. And with their last update to the app itself, the alarm for my streak reminder has disappeared. In addition, when I manually open the app, the screen is white and takes nearly 20 full seconds to load. I definitely will not continue my paid subscription when it’s due for renewal. This app has had too many bugs, glitches, and in hasn’t worked consistently and properly in months.\n\n[22JAN26] MonkeyTaps you say you read every single review..  another week has elapsed and I have not received one single affirmation. I’ve been cleaning ALL my notifications on my iPhone as previously instructed. I’ve updated the app, I’ve rebooted, I’ve manually opened the app, etc., and still nothing. I don’t know why your team hasn’t yet fixed this issue. I do like the app— when it works properly.\n\n[06FEB26] - I guess no one reads this but I’m going to write anyway. My app gave me affirmations all day this past Tuesday after not working for a couple weeks. However, it gave me the “Tap Here to Continue Receiving Affirmations” warning (which was random because it had been giving me my affirmations regularly up to that moment on Tuesday. Since that notification popped up, I’ve had no more affirmations.",
