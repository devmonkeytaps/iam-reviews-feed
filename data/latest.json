If you know me, (which you don‚Äôt) if there is a free app, I WILL GET IT!

Truly this app has helped me cope with myself and it helped show me that not everyone can be perfect or be the person they want to be, if you‚Äôre being yourself, that‚Äôs good enough. This app has changed me in the best way possible and if your reading this because your considering getting this app, I urge you to try it out. If you don‚Äôt love it, you don‚Äôt have to use it. If you love it (which you will) you should totally keep it. I hope this review was informational and I hope it convinced you to get this app. Hope you all have a positive, safe and beautiful day.",

Their description talks about a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù version like it‚Äôs a separate thing that you can upgrade to to get all the benefits for, but the app itself is the full premium version. You get 3 days of free access to the premium version before you have to subscribe. \n\nRespectfully, to anyone reading this, no I‚Äôm not some entitled individual who thinks they should get everything for free. I wouldn‚Äôt be making this if I was told in the description or upon starting the app there would only be 3 days of access before you have to subscribe. I‚Äôm not sure if this was done on purpose or if it was by mistake, but I believe you guys have to be more specific so you don‚Äôt waste anyone‚Äôs time.
