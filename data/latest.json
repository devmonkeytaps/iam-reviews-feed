It seems to pop up in just the right moment when I really need that reminder to keep going, and the messages seem to resonate perfectly. ✨A genius app for those who need mental health affirmations. 💛 As someone who has struggled with MH since childhood, I am so grateful for this little app. I tell everybody about it! A giant thanks + kudos to the developers!🫶✨ Side note: as a Mama of a 5yo + 3yo, and also a 2nd grade teacher…I’d love to see one specifically for kids. Building healthy self talk young and confidence is soo important! 💕",

I was an affirmations naysayer, but have become a convert 😆 One thing that I would love to see is the addition of parenting affirmations. I’m a single mom and it’s hard out here for us! Gentle reminders to give ourselves grace would be so wonderful.",

But for the last 6 months I’ve been receiving no notifications on my iPhone 13 mini, running the latest software on both the app and my phone. I’ve contacted technical support about this, provided robust technical details about my device and app, and I have repeatedly been told that it’s a planned fix in a future update. However, there have been about 40-50 app updates since my initial request, and the only notifications I receive are to “Keep my streak alive!” I didn’t want to write this review. But if you’re going to be a paying customer, you should be aware of this. Thanks for reading.",
