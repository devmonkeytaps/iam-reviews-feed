I enjoyed it at first, but it seems with every update they are removing more and more features from the free version. I’m a college student, and I simply do not have the spare income for a subscription. They are limiting the backgrounds, the customization of the affirmations (and the rest of the app), and now have even taken away the “practice” option, something I used nearly every day. Unfortunately this is a common occurrence with supposedly free apps. I’m not sure how much longer this one will be of use to me. The setup is user friendly, the affirmations are unique and really boosted my self esteem. It was very helpful during a hard time in my life, but I no longer think this is beneficial the way it used to be.",

This fall they came out with the feature to make an account instead of having all your data just saved on your phone. When I did that, I lost hundreds of custom affirmations and collections that I had made for different occasions in my life. Over a month ago, I informed the development team about this and followed up a couple weeks later, and I have received no support or feedback on whether or when they can get my account info restored. I wish I had never created an account at all because when I deleted the app and reinstalled it to see if that would fix some of the bugs, I lost almost everything. It seems that every time an update is released the past few months, there are issues and bugs. I wish the developers would work out these bugs before releasing new updates. But I am still a user and subscriber, and it is a very helpful app. Just I want to warn people to maybe make a back up of your affirmations in another app or journal and do not count on them being safe in your I Am account.",

Which is very unfortunate. It also makes the manifestation affirmations that pop up feel more bitter than anything. I don’t need affirmations on how i can do anything i want, i would like affirmations to be okay with my limits and my body, and be taking things at my own pace. There’s some things people will never be able to do. Thats just a fact, not negativity. Realist gentle affirmations with disabled people in mind should be a filter you can click and opt in to from the very beginning.",

I have specific categories I love and use those in addition to the “general” category, I have the ones I want in my rotation liked so I would expect that affirmations would rotate through most of those categories but they don’t do that anymore. It’s become such a nuisance that I eventually close out of the app altogether after only a minute or two at most. I pay for this app because I used to love the variety of affirmations I would receive so I could expand my horizons and figure out what is challenging for me, please go back to the old algorithm or find a way to fix it, otherwise I will be stopping my use of the subscription altogether.",
