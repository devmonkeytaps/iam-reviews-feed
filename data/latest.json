But for the last 6 months I’ve been receiving no notifications on my iPhone 13 mini, running the latest software on both the app and my phone. I’ve contacted technical support about this, provided robust technical details about my device and app, and I have repeatedly been told that it’s a planned fix in a future update. However, there have been about 40-50 app updates since my initial request, and the only notifications I receive are to “Keep my streak alive!” I didn’t want to write this review. But if you’re going to be a paying customer, you should be aware of this. Thanks for reading.",

I have mine set to spew out little nuggets at me all day long so the app can catch me at any time no matter what kind of mood I maybe in. The only thing I have a problem with is that daily timer thing. Once it disappears, if you’ve tapped a portion of the screen on accident, you can’t get it back. How do I get back to the part of the app that does the daily 15 minute-long training? I accidentally touched my screen and it disappeared before it finished. Plus, I can’t *always* get to it at the originally programmed time. Things come up. Life be life-ing. So why not make a way where I can just find it in the app and do it when I have the time available if I happen to miss my regularly appointed time?",
